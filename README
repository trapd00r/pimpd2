NAME
    pimpd2 - Perl Interface for the Music Player Daemon 2

DESCRIPTION
    pimpd2 is a command-line based MPD client that implements all the
    features the author was missing from the other awesome client, mpc.

FEATURES
    -np, --now-playing
            Show basic song information on a single line.

    -i, --info
            Show all available song information and MPD server status.

    -cp, --copy
            Copy the currently playing song to destination.

            If destination is omitted, uses the $target_directory variable
            from the configuration file.

    -cpa, --copy-album
            Copy the currently playing album to destination.

            If destination is omitted, uses the $target_directory variable
            from the configuration file.

    -sh, --shell
            Spawn the interactive pimpd2 shell.

            All the regular features can be used. Commands that return data
            that can be added to the current playlist will do so
            automagically for convenience, since we can not read from
            standard input while being interactive.

    -q, --queue
            Queue tracks. Arguments must be valid playlist position IDs as
            shown in the "--playlist" output.

            You can also use the "--search-playlist" command if the tracks
            to be queued follows a pattern.

  PLAYLIST INTERACTION
    -pls, --playlist
            Show the current playlist.

    --playlists
            List all playlists known by MPD.

    -af, --add-files
            Add files to the current playlist.

            Can read from standard input:

              pimpd2 --randomize 42 Nirvana | pimpd2 -af

            Accepts file arguments:

              pimpd2 -af ~/music/Nirvana/Bleach/*.flac

    -a, --add-playlist
            Add playlist to the current playlist.

            If not given a full name, and the name partially matches
            existing playlists, prompts for input:

              pimpd2 -a 2010

                0 2010-12-indie
                1 2010-12-other
                2 2010-12-pop
                3 2010-12-punk_rock
                4 2010-12-rock
                5 2010-12-undef
              choice:

            If choice equals 'all', all matching playlists are added.

    -r, --randomize
            Return n random songs from the collection. The first argument is
            the number of songs, the second argument is an optional artist
            name. If an artist name is specified, will only return random
            songs from that particular artist.

            If no arguments are specified, returns 100 random songs.

            If you want to add the results to the current playlist, pipe it
            to "--add-files":

              pimpd2 -r 12 | pimpd2 -af

            Or use the interactive shell ( "-sh" ) which does this for you
            automatically.

    -ra, --random-album
            Return n random full albums.

            A pipe to "--add-files" will add the results to the current
            playlist.

    -rma, --rmalbum
            Given a string, searches the current playlist for matching
            albums, and remove them from the playlist. The string can be a
            regular expression.

    -f, --love
            Favorize, or love, the current song.

            If called with zero arguments, the song will be saved to a
            playlist following this naming scheme:

              %year-%month-%genre.m3u

            Else, the argument is used for the playlist name, thus:

              pimpd2 --love lovesongs

            adds the song to lovesongs.m3u

    --loved Check if the currently playing song is already loved or not.

    -lsp, --lsplaylist
            List songs in external playlists. The logic from
            "--add-playlist" is used here as well:

              pimpd2 -sip 2010

                0 2010-12-indie
                1 2010-12-other
                2 2010-12-pop
                3 2010-12-punk_rock
                4 2010-12-rock
                5 2010-12-undef
              Choice:

            thus 'all' or simply hitting enter will list all songs in all
            playlists matching '2010'.

    --slove Search the database with loved songs for PATTERN.

            If PATTERN is omitted, returns all loved songs.

    -spl, --search-playlist
            Search the current playlist for string, possibly a regular
            expression.

            If more then one song is found, queues up the results. See
            "--queue".

  COLLECTION INTERACTION
    -lsa, --songs
            List all songs on album.

            If no argument is specified, use the album tag from the
            currently playing song.

            A pipe to "--add-files" will add the results to the current
            playlist:

              pimpd2 -lsa Stripped | pimpd2 -af

    -l, --albums
            List all albums where artist is featured.

            If no argument is specified, use the artist tag from the
            currently playing song.

    -sdb, --search-db
            Search the database for string, possibly a regular expression.

            A pipe to "--add-files" will add the results to the current
            playlist:

    -sar, --search-artist
            Search the database for artist.

            A pipe to "--add-files" will add the results to the current
            playlist:

    -sal, --search-album
            Search the database for album.

            A pipe to "--add-files" will add the results to the current
            playlist:

    -set, --search-title
            Search the database for title.

            A pipe to "--add-files" will add the results to the current
            playlist:
